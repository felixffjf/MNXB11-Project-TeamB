30/10 - Made a copy of Sofia's 10 year filter and adjusted it to filter all data between 1950-2023
      - Wrote c++ code which plots the difference between the highest and lowest temperature of each year.
      - Adjusted code to make sure the scaling is correct 
      - Made sure any file could be put in and plot given a unique name
      - Added trendline
      - Further adjusted bash script to name the output filtered file name to simply be the city name.

      - Adjusted the makefile so it also opens the tarball
